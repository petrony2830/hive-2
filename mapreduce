Mapper is the same as before and it outputs user_id (tab) 1:

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
 
for line in sys.stdin:
    record = line.split("::")
    if len(record) == 4:
		print record[0], "\t1"	# user_id (tab) 1
Reducer is a bit tricky (if you try to copy/paste this code from the web - double check all indentations):

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
 
# initial values
temp_count = 0
temp_word = None
ratings = {}
 
for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()
    word, count = line.split('\t', 1)
    if word == temp_word:
        temp_count = temp_count + 1
    else:
	# this part is new
	try:
            ratings[temp_count] = ratings[temp_count] + 1
        except:
            ratings[temp_count] = 1
        temp_word = word
        temp_count = 1

# output very last word in the list
try:
    ratings[temp_count] = ratings[temp_count] + 1
except:
    ratings[temp_count] = 1

del ratings[0]

# output all results
for count in ratings.keys():
    print count, "\t", ratings[count]
