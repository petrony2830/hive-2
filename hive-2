CREATE TABLE newtable AS SELECT ratings.UserID, users.Gender, ratings.Rating

SELECT Gender, COUNT(Rating) FROM newtable GROUP BY Gender;

As you can see, there are seven commands only:

First three commands are just cleaning for existing tables as I tested the entire code several times.
Next two commands - creating tables and loading data
Then, one command is JOIN of two tables and creating new table
And finally, count ratings by gender in new table and output.
If you already have proper tables in the system then there are just two last commands required to get results. Compare it with your Python code.
